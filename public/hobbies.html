<h2>Travel</h2>
    <p>Whether it's just a short local break or a long international holiday, the world offers interesting history and beautiful places to explore. My wife is my favourite travel buddy.</p>

<h2>Field Hockey</h2>
    <p>I've played hockey since I was 7 years old. I love the team environment and competition.</p>
    <p>In my youth I was a useful player - now I enjoy mentoring my much younger team mates!</p>

<h2>Charitable work</h2>
    <p>I love being able to help those less fortunate than myself. I get involved through my church or in my local community wherever I can.</p>

<h2>Music</h2>
    <p>I've played the guitar since I was 10 and developed a love for a wide range of music as I grew up.</p>
    <p>My CD collection (now Spotify) ranges from classical to rock. I miss being able to browse though other people's CD collections while visiting.</p>
