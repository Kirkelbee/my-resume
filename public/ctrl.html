<h1>Channel Tunnel Rail Link</h1>
<hr/>
<p>My role was as a setting out engineer, ensuring that the construction crews knew the lines and levels they needed to achieve with their timber, steel and concrete.</p>
<h2>Some of the structures I worked on include:</h2>
<ul> 
    <li><p>Longham Wood Retaining Wall:<br/>
        A section of the rail was cut through between the M20 motorway and an unstable embankment. We had to cast over 150 enormous concrete piles with 1.2m diameters over 25m deep.</p></li>
    <li><p>Burnt Ash pedetrian bridge:<br/>
        A small footbridge to maintain the public pathway across the new railway.</p></li>
    <li><p>Hollingbourne Tunnel:<br/>
        When the new rail route passed close to small villages it was encased in precast tunnels and buried.</p></li>
    <li>Harrietsham Tunnel:<br/>
